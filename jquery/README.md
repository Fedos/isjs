### Contibution

Feel free to contibute in any way you see fit. Just try to keep the coding style that I've chosen in this project and don't break the code :)

To run tests make sure you've got [testem](https://github.com/airportyh/testem) installed on your system. Simply run the following command in the terminal to start testing:

	$ testem
